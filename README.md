  Did you know that octopuses have three hearts and blue blood? Two of their hearts pump blood to their gills, while the third heart pumps it to the rest of their body. The blue color comes from a copper-based molecule called hemocyanin, which is more efficient at transporting oxygen in cold, low-oxygen environments compared to the iron-based hemoglobin found in most other animals!

Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. Honey's low water content and acidic pH create an inhospitable environment for bacteria and microorganisms, which gives it its remarkable shelf life.
